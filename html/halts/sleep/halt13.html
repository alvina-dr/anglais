            <p class="halt_text">Can we talk about sleeping without mentioning sleep disorders?
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">When people think about sleep, they often associate it with wellness, tranquillity, silence, a break in a hard day.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">
                But, in Africa, sleep can also be a synonym of illness, and anxiety. I want to talk about sleeping sickness. The sleeping sickness is a tropical illness that people living in Africa can often be exposed to. This illness is transmitted to humans by tsetse
                fly. If you don’t have treatment, the virus will enter in your nervous system and will cause sleep troubles first, or even death. The symptoms can be invisible during several months or years, but when it appears, the death will arrive
                fast.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">The World Health Organisation developed a special program to eradicate the disease in Africa, especially in the countryside where people seem to have a significant risk of being infected.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">To fight against this illness, the organisation as several focus :<br>- First, they try to kill the tsetse fly. If there is less tsetse fly, they will less bite humans. <br>- Secondly, they organised testings all over the country to be able
                to take care earlier. If people receive medicine earlier, they have more chances to cure it.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">Gradually, the illness decreases in Africa, and, for the first time, in 2018 less than 1000 situations were noticed on the continent.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">Can we already say that the illness killed more than COVID ? I think so. But as it happened in Africa, nobody wanted to find a solution ?
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">Now, to be sure to contain the disease, the World Health Organisation continues to be vigilant about its evolution and to collect money to fight more and more !
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">I want to talk about sleep apnea and narcolepsy now.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">First of all, let me introduce the concept of sleep apnea. This is a breathing problem which happens during the night. Several times a night, you stop breathing for 10 to 30 seconds. Everytime, you wake up during a little amount of time so
                you can’t really rest. Of course, the day after is not the same. This affects your life quality a lot.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">Moreover, this illness is invisible. 80% of sick people don’t know that they’re affected. In fact, you can be tired due to many other reasons. And everyone can be affected, including children, even if the risk grows when you get older.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">To determine the diagnosis, you need to look after the person during a whole night, with a special machine. If it is positive, you’ll need to use an artificial respirator every night, which will allow you to breath during the night and to
                have better days.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">Conversely, sleeping too well can also be a real problem. Narcolepsy hits 1 person over 2800, equally men or women. Currently, science can’t explain the reasons for this disease. There are many factors implicated. To explain, the illness can
                have 2 consequences :<br>- The person can feel sleepy all day and fall asleep several times. <br>- He possibly seems ok but falls asleep at any moment for no reasons. It’s like a flash. At this moment, he can fall and hurt himself.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">As a conclusion, nowadays, there are no treatments to cure the illness. The doctors advices to have a healthy lifestyle. It can improve the situation but there are no definitive solutions.
