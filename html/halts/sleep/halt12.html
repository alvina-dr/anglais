            <p class="halt_text">Have you ever heard about sleepwalking ? Have you already seen the phenomenon ? It’s absolutely impressive !
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">Around 4% of the population is affected by this nocturnal disease. Sleepwalking is a sleep disorder that can appear when you feel anxious or stressed. It’s a parasomnia, which is a set of abnormal motor or sensory phenomena during sleep. The
                cause of sleepwalking would therefore be poor coordination between our sleep and “wake” systems which means the sleepwalker would enter in a phase of dissociated awakening !
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">
                You should know that sleep is not a global phenomenon, so, depending on the time of the night, sleep is different. In a somnambulism phase, the person can walk, talk, write or anything else while they are still sleeping.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">A long time ago, scientists thought that it was dangerous to wake up a sleepwalker, but now we actually know how to do it safely. If you take care and act slowly to be sure that the walker won’t fall or hurt themselves then nothing bad will
                happen. If you’re brutal though, the sleepwalker will be distressed and agitated which can lead to a risky situation.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">Sleepwalking can also be dangerous in a particular context. A somnambulist can have some episodes of violence : the somnambulist can hurt himself, and for example, injure himself and his partner, haematoma, broken bones... The day after, they
                might not even remember what happened and what they did. Sometimes though, if you slowly wake up a somnambulist, they can keep some memories of their time as a sleepwalker.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">Frequently, we know that we have had an episode of sleepwalking when the room is upside down, or we wake up somewhere else …
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">There are treatments for this ailment. We know that in many cases of sleepwalking, the somnambulist shows signs of stress, sleep deprivation or even depression. As a first step, the patient must be accustomed to a better lifestyle in an adapted
                center where they will be offered behavioral therapies. But, sometimes, it’s not enough. In reality, we don’t know sufficiently about this ailment to cure it.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">Sleeping can be an adventure, doesn’t it ?
