        <div class="column tier_text">
            <p class="halt_text">First of all, a sleep cycle lasts around one hour and a half. Which means, we go through multiple cycles during the night (from 4 to 6). A sleep cycle is composed of four stages (as established in the most recent studies, contrary to the five
                we determined before). The first step is when you’re actually still conscious but really drowsy, on the edge of falling asleep. In this state, your muscles are still contracted and you can still wake up easily if something disturbs you.
                This first step only lasts a few minutes before you enter the second phase. Then your muscles relax, your heart rate and your breathing slow down. Eye movement stops. You usually spend half your sleeping time in stage 2.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">I’m sure you already felt this transition between stage 1 and 2 of sleep. Here’s an example you might relate with. When you’re holding your phone in the car and you’re falling asleep, you’ll be able to keep it in your hand in the first phase.
                But at the moment you transition from step 1 to step 2 (or from a state of drowsiness to a light sleep) your muscles are going to relax and most of the time your phone is going to fall. </p>

            <p class="halt_text"> The third stage of sleep - also named “delta sleep” is when your brain activity takes the pattern of delta waves. Your breathing and heart rate slow even more and your body relaxes further. This is the deepest sleep, where it’s very difficult
                to wake someone up. This stage is one of the most important. It’s when your body recovers its strength and if you’re young it’s also when you grow. Recent studies even established that it might be the key to a stronger immune system.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">Finally the fourth and last stage of sleep. This one is different from the others. In this phase, your eyes are going to move very quickly in what we name REM (for Rapid Eye Movement). The other stages were NREM for non-REM. The brain waves
                of someone in stage 4 of sleep will look very similar to someone awakened. It’s because you’re dreaming. You think you’re awake and so does your brain. During this stage, your muscles are paralysed except for those controlling your breathing
                and your eyes. Early in the night, REM stage only lasts a few minutes, but as you go through multiple cycles, it will get longer and longer and eventually lasts around one hour.
