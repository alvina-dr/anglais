            <p class="halt_text">Sleep habits change from country to country. The Spanish developed a rather surprising sleep habit : Indeed, they tend to go to bed very late, and, in order to avoid the heat of the day, take a nap in the afternoon. So when you walk around
                Spain, don't be surprised to see the stores closed at 2 p.m., the vendors are just taking their naps!
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">This Spanish practice is also found in Italy, then called the “riposo”, the latter of which can last up to 4 hours!
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">
                Another country with surprising sleep patterns is Japan. Japan is one of the countries where people sleep the least. This is the consequence of making workers tired : they fall asleep especially in public places, or, in public transport ! They practice
                "inemuri". And this practice makes them proud ! For them, someone falling asleep in public transport, for example, proves that they are doing hard work, and that their exhaustion is due to long hours of work.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">In China, people developed funny habits for their naps ! They tend to go to Ikea as a family, to sleep there ! However, they don’t buy anything but do not hesitate to come together to bask in the different beds on display.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">Norwegians are very brave when it comes to naps: as they are used to low temperatures, some people can practice naps outside, in parks for example, even in -5 °!
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">In Botswana, you can find a tribe of hunter-gatherers, the Kungs. They decided that if they are tired, they can sleep, and it doesn’t matter if it’s early in the day. So there is no real bedtime, you can sleep when you need it!
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">But what are the main benefits of a nap, in fact ?
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">The nap has many virtues such as muscle recovery, stress reduction, improving concentration. It also boosts creativity and increases energy. The ideal time to take a nap is between 12 (12h) a.m. and 3 p.m., because it is the time when alertness
                and body temperature decrease.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">Recently, more and more companies have set up a space dedicated to rest. Indeed, a NASA study has shown that a nap can boost productivity by 35%! Companies like Orange, Renault, Danone or “Léa Nature” already introduced this practice in their
                offices, providing employees a room with massage chairs, ottomans, deckchairs... And contrary to popular belief, it's better to waste 20 minutes to rest than a long hour! Beyond these 20 minutes, we are in a deep sleep, it lasts about
                1 hour 30 minutes, and by interrupting this sleep, you can even feel more tired !
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">We can conclude that the nap is very important, whatever the country !
            </p>
