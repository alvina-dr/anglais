        <div class="column tier_text">
            <p class="halt_text">As you can imagine, thinking about sleep and dreams is not a recent matter … Greek mythology has its own old theories and its own gods. I want to name Hypnos, god of sleep and night guardian (known to the Romans under the name of Somnus.)

            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">Hypnos is considered as the Night’s son. His mother is called Nix. Hypnos is a young god, wearing wings that allows him to fly all over the world. His flight is silent and you can imagine him as a dark bird in the night, delivering sleep.
                Greek mythology considers Hypnos as the sweetest and quietest god : When he comes, he allows everyone to forget about reality and troubles.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">
                To realise his job, Hypnos is helped by his sons, including Morphée, one of the most well-known gods when you want to speak about sleep in France, with for example the expression “Tomber dans les bras de Morphée”. Morphée is the god of dreams. Mythology
                says that Hypnos directly intercede in humans or gods dream to give them information or advice. Sometimes, even other gods may impose their wishes on mortals and force them to act the way they want.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">For instance, Athena will enter Penelope's dream to comfort her about Telemaque, her son. She will also make Nausisaa go to wash her clothes and meet Ulysse. Actually, you can sometimes see a graphic representation of Hypnos on tombs to represent
                an eternal sleep.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">We can suppose too that the word «hypnosis» comes from the greek Hypnos because of the similarities between a hypnotized and an asleep person.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">We can also talk about the Egyptian god Bes, who has many functions as gods, and among others, that is the guardian of the sleep of the Egyptians. The latter guarantees calm and peaceful nights by ruling out all hostile and malicious powers.
                The Egyptians decorated their beds with representations of the god to watch over them. This is why Bes is often represented with weapons : he can thus ward off the enemies of the dreams of the Egyptians by cutting them.
