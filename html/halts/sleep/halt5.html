            <p class="halt_text">Senoïs are a pacific tribe, living in Malaysia. They are specials because they are resistant to stress and mental illness. Their resistance comes from their lifestyle. They have always been known for their practice of lucid dreaming (which
                we are going to explain later). To tell it in a few words : for them, what you are living during the day is as important as what is happening in your dreams.(An interesting book about that is “Le sixième sommeil” by Bernard Werber) This
                tribe is called “the people of dream” by other people.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">In the tribe, every morning, everybody talks about their dreams and shares what they lived during their sleep. According to them, the dream is a better teaching than reality. And they take this very seriously. For example, if someone dreams
                of hurting someone else, they will have to tell them the next day, and offer a present as an act of forgiveness. Or if a member of the tribe dreamed of being injured by another member, he would tell his oniric aggressor who would have
                to give him a present in the morning. The most appreciated and desired dream is the flight.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">The Senois isn’t a warrior trib, but the other tribes were afraid of them because they had a mystical dimension with their practises. According to the stories of people who met the trib, the Senois are different now, exposed to the world (globalization),
                the cult of the dreams disappeared. But let’s come back to what we wrote earlier. What’s a lucid dream ?
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">Most of the time when you dream you feel tossed around by the events, changing scenes, doing stuff that makes no sense.... Nothing’s logical in a dream but our brain forces us to accept this different world as a reality.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">Although, sometimes, the dreamer gets to stay conscious. And when we say conscious, it can go from being aware that we are dreaming and yet endure the dream as always to being able to totally control it, like a self-proclaimed god in our own
                head. So there are many different levels of lucidity.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">Today, lots of methods exist to lucid dream. There are studies, videos, books about it... The most famous technique is to try to remember your dreams when you wake up and write them down in a book. What you can also do is invent a sort of
                test to know if you dream or not. For example you can take a look at your hands. This is simple. If you do it during the day, your hands look normal, but in a dream they’ll often look strange, deformed, there will be too many fingers or
                not enough, or your hands will be green or whatever your brain can possibly imagine. So if you check your hands like five times a day (you just need to put an alarm to remember), there’s a real chance that you will check them during your
                dream and notice the difference. And if you do notice, then you know you’re not awake, you know you’re dreaming. You become lucid.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">Here’s a few other things you can do to try to make a lucid dream. First make some research about it. If the subject interests you and you think about it, your unconscious might play with the idea.

            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">Then, you can also put an alarm an hour before actually waking up in the morning. This will allow you to start a new sleep cycle and fall asleep and reach the REM stage really quickly because of how tired you will be at the moment. And you’ll
                still somehow be conscious that you’ll have to wake up soon (which will make you more conscious of yourself in the dream and allow you to become lucid).
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">Last thing you can do is try to imagine yourself at first person a lot. If you do so, you’ll be able to do it more often in your dreams and you practically only lucid dream if you're in your own point of view (and not looking at yourself from
                the outside which happens more often than we realise).
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">Most of the time when you actually realise you’re dreaming, it’s very exciting, very powerful so that wakes you up. But if you try every night, you’ll become used to the sensation and be able to stay calm and continue your dreams while being
                lucid.
