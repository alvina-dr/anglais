        <div class="column tier_text">
            <p class="halt_text">Lack of sleep increases appetite for large portions of high-calorie foods. The fault is the overproduction of ghrelin, appetite hormone.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">The consequences of sleep deprivation are most often underestimated. The most recent scientific studies show how a single night of less than 6 hours of sleep has physical and psychological effects on our health and emotions.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">
                A lack of sleep disturbs selective attention, including the difficulty of focusing on one piece of information at a time.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">Sleep plays a big role in the phenomenon of memorization, the sorting of new learnings. Lack of sleep prevents this consolidation of memory. Lack of sleep leads to mood disorders and irritability.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">Sleep deprivation weakens immune function. A night of sleep that lasts less than 7 hours multiplies by 3 the risk of catching a cold. The risk is multiplied by 5 if you have serious sleep problems.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">A sleep duration of less than 7 hours is associated with an increased risk of diabetes. Subjects sleeping less than 6 hours per night are at a high risk of having cardiovascular disease 15% more compared to those with a normal sleep duration
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">The association between night sleep duration and mortality risk is characterized by a U-curve, with the highest risk in short and long sleepers.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">SLEEPING PILLS ARE NOT THE SOLUTION
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">They alter the quality of sleep and have deleterious effects on health, as revealed in an English study of 100,000 people, divided into two groups, over an average of 7 years. Anxiolytics and sleeping pills were consumed by about a third of
                the subjects, the others took nothing. “The results are implacable,” says Dr. Patrick Lemoine. “The risk of mortality is almost double in the first group.”
