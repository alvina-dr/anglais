            <p class="halt_text">In China, the pace of economic progress seems to go hand in hand with that of sleep. Sleep time is essential for well-being. It is important for productivity, even when the ultimate goal is to maximize revenues.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">People in the Asia-Pacific region seem to have understood this: they spend most of their free time ( well over half ) on personal hygiene, which starts with sleep. The Chinese are the largest sleepers in the Asia-Pacific region, with an average
                of nine hours of sleep per day.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">In all countries in the region except Korea and Japan, people spend a lot of time sleeping. Sleep accounts for more than 70% of free time.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">In China, there is a whole Chinese medicine around sleep. The "Qi", what we do during the day and the emotions we feel have an impact on our sleep, which can lead to a disturbance of Qi and therefore organs.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">For Chinese medicine, which dates back more than 3,000 B.C. Each organ has a physical and emotional function that maximizes over a two-hour cycle. If this cycle is disrupted by a night awakening, it means that you have a deficient organ.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">Sleeping on the right side is the position recommended by traditional Chinese medicine, simply because the blood returns to the liver in this position and provides a calm sleep. This position also makes digestion easier because the stomach
                more easily drains the fondue you ate two hours earlier to the intestines.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">Several studies have found coherence between Chinese business development and their sleep. So sleep has a really important place in Chinese culture.
