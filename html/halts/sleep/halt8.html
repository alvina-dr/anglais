            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">Japaneseâ€™s sleep lasts 4 to 6 hours a night. Leaving the office before the chief, is against the rules of politeness. Energy drinks are free after 10 pm in large companies.

            <p class="halt_text">
                Falling asleep briefly is tolerated at school, at work and even in parliament. These micro naps are called inemuri, we can translate it by sleeping while being present.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">They sleep differently, and their perception of sleep is not the same: it is considered a waste of time, because you have to know how to put your personal interests aside for higher interests.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">The books on Japanese sleep are among the best-sellers in bookstores, with titles like "4h of effective sleep" or "the lie of 8h of sleep".
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">Officially the inemuri (micro nap) is not allowed in classes, but teachers tolerate it, otherwise they could not keep up with the pace of studies.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">Sleep deficit is chronic in Japan and Korea, they do not give the same meaning to their need for sleep as we do. They rest in a fragmented way, spread over the day.
