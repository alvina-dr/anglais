            <p class="halt_text">Even though in our days, sleep seems to be more complicated than before to achieve, we’ve invented lots of ways to improve the experience ! We’ve now got comfortable earbuds to cancel the noise of snoring or produce relaxing sounds and music.
                Pillows, beds, covers can include a temperature regulator… We’ve got gadgets such as watchs, wristbands, headbands to analyse our sleep (brain waves, pulse, breath...). There are even phone apps for this job, although clearly not as effective.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">As breathing plays an important part in falling asleep, you can find help in technology. From apps, to robots by way of belt gadgets… There are lots of solutions.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">
                Because waking up can also be painful, humans also invented more gentle ways to stop sleeping. The lights can slowly bring you to the surface, some smell diffusers can raise you up with the scent of croissants, soft music can start, etc… Step by step,
                humans are making sleeping a whole new experience. Most of us are going to spend a third of their life sleeping, so of course it’s only logical we want to make it better. And even if all those gadgets are not our reality today, they could
                very well be a big part of tomorrow.
