            <p class="halt_text">Do you know what is as important as sleeping ? Dreaming, of course ! A dream is a build of your imagination, happening during your sleep. Neurosciences are studying why dreams are useful and they came up with this answer for now : they train
                your brain to be ready to face hard or stressful situations in real life. Nightmares can, among other things, allow some people to confront their fears and overcome them. Bad dreams, therefore, allow another approach to life, and to our
                fears. But dreams are also useful in other ways. For memorization for example. In fact, neurons stimulated during the day seem to “work” at night to create links between them and to consolidate them. This is one of the reasons why doctors
                often repeat that a good night of sleep is essential to learn better.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">Dreams also make it possible to classify the information received during the day, and to temper the negative emotions attached to it. This is what allows us to rethink a problem and to apprehend it better the next day. Hence the famous French
                expression: "la nuit porte conseil”.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text"> Dreaming also helps reduce some painful feelings. Dreams thus become “night therapy”. It is also the dreams that stimulate our creativity: indeed, many inventions, films, or songs would have emerged after a dream ! The dream acts as an incubator
                of creativity. While sleeping, the brain lets go by making unusual associations of ideas, which can turn out to be genius ideas !
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">This is how, without knowing it, dreams have such an important place in our life, and allow us to face all kinds of situations.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">So, even if you don’t remember them, be sure your dreams are useful !
