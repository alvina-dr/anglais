            <p class="halt_text">Today, most people are monophasic sleepers. That means that they are sleeping only one time a day, for around 7 to 8 hours. As we will mention in a later halt, other people also have biphasic sleep, which consists in general of a short night
                of sleep and a nap after lunch. But there’s another kind of sleep pattern, that’s less famous. Polyphasic sleep. It consists of taking lots of quick naps during the day, enough to accumulate around a maximum of five hours of sleep. Each
                nap usually lasts from 20 min to 2 hours.

            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">What you might not know is that polyphasic sleep (also known as fragmented sleep) was quite common a few decades ago. People were literally waking up at midnight to go out and meet their friends. Some writers today are still doing it, they’re
                waking up during the night on purpose just to write. And lots of animals are sleeping polyphasically. Take a cat for example. They’re the perfect models of fragmented sleepers. Studies have shown that it was actually more natural even
                for us to sleep this way ! In reality, the idea that we need to rest for the day in a single sleep is pretty recent.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">But why are most of us sleeping monophasically then ? Well, for plenty of people, it's to adapt to the world around them. It seems pretty difficult for students today to just skip class to take a nap. There’s the same problem when you have
                a job, you’ll have to look a while before you find a boss who accepts this organization. Because it’s different, it’s not in our current culture to sleep this way, and humans are afraid of what they don’t know.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">But after a few weeks of experience, we see abnormalities in the sleep-wake rhythm. The alternation of waking phases and sleeping phases continues, and keeps a stable proportion of 2/3 of awakening for 1/3 of sleep. But these alterations are
                disrupted. Some "day-night" cycles reach 60 hours, others are shorter and last only about 12 hours.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">The most effective polyphasic sleep technique is named Uberman. You’re supposed to only sleep 2 hours a day. In order to do that, you have to take a 20 minutes nap every 4 hours. This way, you only spend around 8% of your day sleeping against
                33% with monophasic sleep. The difference is huge ! Just imagine, being able to be awake for 6 more hours every day !

            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">Another great effect of polyphasic sleep is being able to reach REM sleep very quickly. Your sleep cycle is going to shorten and be more efficient. Your body will just go to the point and try to rest a maximum in a minimum amount of time.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">Although polyphasic sleep seems like a big gain of time, it’s very difficult to put into practice. You’ll need loads of motivation to be able to reach the small number of 2 hours of sleep a day. And if you just skip a nap or oversleep, your
                whole pattern will be over and it’ll be near impossible to continue.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">But well, it’s still appealing isn’t it ?
