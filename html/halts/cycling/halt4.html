                Keirin is a Japanese sport where cyclists race each other on an outside velodrome. Begin with a launched start over 3km (6 laps). Keirin velodromes are known around the world as "temple of cycling" because the place is very quiet despite being full of
                supporters. Japanese people enjoy this sport a lot because it is one of the only places you can legally bet on. This sport is called "Cycling Billion yen races'' because it is even more economically powerful. Created in 1948 by the japanese
                government to get taxes on the gambeling, it has inspired over the years the european to create the occidental version of Kerin.

                There are over 50 traditional velodromes and more than 5000 professional athletes over the country of Japan. Many of these athletes are stronger than the european track riders, but as they get well paid in Japan, they don't face european riders. Every
                rider has the same bike (made by only 1 brand) so it is perfectly equal. Each race gets 9 riders to face each other. Riders wear protection as they can touch each other, crashes happen oftenly. Oh, and bikes are fixies, so there are no
                brakes.
