                Switzerland is one of the most famous countries when it comes to mountain biking. The whole country is made of mountains, so it is kind of a traditional sport there. A lot of swiss citizens are practicing MTB for fun and in family, but the real interest
                of swiss cycling is the top level of the discipline : the Olympics Games and the UCI World Cup. Since the 90’s, more than a quarter of Switzerland’s Top 8 finishes at the Summer Olympics were won by cyclists, and since Sydney 2000, Swiss
                cycling representatives have won eleven Olympic medals. With the rise of swiss domination in this sport, new talents were discovered : Nino Schurter, 2016 Olympic Champion, 8 times world champion in a row, 2020 european Champion, 8 times
                swiss champion, and 7 world cup overall wins. This man has revolutionized not only swiss mtb, but also the whole mtb world. New events and races were created as the swiss man was growing stronger, like the Swiss Epic, one of the first
                mtb stage races.
