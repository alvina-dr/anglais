                When we talk about cycling it is 99 percent of the time about a two wheel frame where you sit on it. But this disposition doesn’t fit everybody, and everybody should be able to ride a bike right ? So one day, an engineer that had his son handicaped came
                with an idea : why don’t we ride our bikes by laying down on them ? And so on he came out with this prototype that later on became even faster than traditional bikes ! Actually when you are laying down on this recumbent, you are way more
                aerodynamic because you don’t directly interfere with air in front of you. This way, some disabled people can compete with their friends, and aeromaniacs can go as fast as cars by riding with their legs ! The recumbent hour record (the
                most KM ridden by a recumbent in an hour) is actually over 89km/h ! At first sight it looks weird and undrivable, but if you want more stability you can go with a 3 wheel one! We think that any invention that provides more cycling for
                everyone is better don’t you think ?
