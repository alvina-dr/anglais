                How can we do a whole thing about cycling without talking about THE race. The most known and recognised race of all time, with its symbol, the famous Maillot Jaune. Where can we start ? In 1903, where bikes were twice as heavy, and when you could directly
                fix them at the “Maréchal-ferrand”. Starting in front of the “Le réveil Matin café”, it introduced the tradition on the coffee stop amongst the riders. The stages were 300km long and were ridden by night. Then on the bikes evolved, from
                steel to aluminium, and then carbon fiber. It has revealed legends of the sport such as Eddy Merckx or Bernard Hinault, and made some places legendary such as Le Mont Ventoux, or Le col du Tourmalet. It has over the years been showing
                the french patrimony and its landscapes with the nice organization of ASO.

                For Christian Prudhomme, actual president of the Amaury Sport Organisation, “Le Tour is a wonderful showcase of French culture over the world”. As it is broadcasted in more than 180 countries, Le Tour is the second most watched sport event in the world,
                just behind the Super Bowl. Some of it’s editions were very political, for example the 1987 edition (see the article.) It is federating peoples for their leader like Julian Alaphilippe last year. The winner of Le Tour is not winning a
                lot of money, for comparison, he gets 1/10 of the prize money of Roland Garros.
