                We often talk about the Tour that took place in 1987 during the cold war, when the Wall was still standing. The very first stage which is called “the prologue” is always a time trial. Back in the days the bikes looked very differently than nowadays. The
                time trial was following the Wall borders, just to show the Western-block cultural power (picture on top). This way, people from the eastern-block could see the action. This picture and this situation actually shows how a sports event
                such as Le Tour can be a powerful political weapon. This Tour had 3 stages in Berlin, and 4 in Western Germany.

                On the other notable events on this tour we can say that it has been won by Stephen Roche (the only Irish winner ever), it has also the first and only time trial that finished in the top of the Mont Ventoux.
