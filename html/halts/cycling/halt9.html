                The Netherlands capital is well known for the huge amount of bikes in its streets. Amsterdam is perfectly set up for getting on your bike – there are around 515km (320 miles) of dedicated cycle lanes. Amsterdam is routinely rated as the world’s 2nd most
                bike-friendly city, just behind Copenhagen.Cycling is deeply ingrained into the Dutch psyche at all levels of society – not surprising when you consider how flat most of the country is.The Netherlands has a population of 17.1 million people
                and about a quarter of those (4.25million) cycle every day. There are actually more bikes than people – 22.8 million bikes or about 1.33 bikes per person. On top of this there are nearly 2 million electric e-bikes on the road, which have
                been quickly gaining popularity, particularly amongst the elderly.For expats and residents the bicycle becomes a cheap and essential way of getting around town… and it will keep you fit!
