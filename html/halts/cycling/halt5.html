                Down under tour is a cycling event that takes place in Australia. It is a really good spotlight for the underrated culture of this magnificent country, as it crosses many places that we don’t know about. It is one of the very first races of the calendar
                and usually is a “lab” to see how fit the riders are at the beginning of the season. Even though it is planned in January, it is one of the hottest races in the calendar as it is summer at this period of the year (even more when they cross
                the desert).

                It was cancelled last year because of the Australians fire, and it will not take place in 2020 because of the global pandemic. It misses cruelly to the australian's peoples as well as the government because it shows to the world their cosmopolitanism.
                All the native and tribes are usually interviewed at this occasion, and we can figure out how they use to live, and what their traditions are. This tour is part of “the tryptic of the southern hemisphere”, composed by New zealand Tour
                for example.
