                In Colombia there is a fever for cycling. They live for it, eat for it, and cheer for their leaders all around the world. Their flag is oftenly present on the side of the road, even more oftenly than the french Britain flag. Colombians riders are very
                strong on mountain stages, as they live at high altitudes. This picture shows a colombian farmer keeping the wheel of professional rider Rigoberto Uran with a TimeTrial bike (3rd on Tour de France some years ago.) Colombia was the first
                country to have a professional team riding against private sponsored teams at a Grand Tour.

                They were exclusively composed of Colombians riders and even got some stage wins at Tour de France 1975. This is the only team financially helped by state fundings (Kazakhstan is not directly giving funds to the Astana pro team.) When the young Egan Bernal
                won the Tour last year, the whole country turned insane, even more than if they'd won the football world cup. He is more recognised in Colombia than Maradona is in Argentina.
