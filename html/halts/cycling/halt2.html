                Well, the title is not very accurate. We will get you through the unusual situation of Eritrean pro cyclists. First, let’s settle what is going on in Eritrea. This country is independent since 1993, and has been since with Ethiopia. They are ranked just
                before North Korea in the Human rights respectness ranking. (source : Amnesty international for UN) The young Eritrean gets indefinite period military service. This produced a massive emigration wave from many Eritrean families. Their
                childs when they get to Europe try cycling, and as Ethiopian are insanely good at marathons because of their high O² rate, Eritreans are insanely good at cycling.

                So they cycle for European teams and are pretty good at it. This creates this situation where Eritrea has literally no cycling structure, and they still are a Top 20 cycling country in terms of points, and a Top 10 in terms of victories. So with the Eritrean
                regime actually refusing to organize any cycling event, the Eritrean National criterium, that decides the Eritrean champion, is the only one in the world that doesn’t take place in its original country.
