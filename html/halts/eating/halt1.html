        <div class="column tier_text">
            <p class="halt_text">The impact of our food on the planet :
                To begin with, we eat more meat than our body needs. Moreover, to produce a steak you need 4500L of water. We consume about 352,000 tons of meat per year in the world, this production needs 4320 billion liters of water, which is equal to 13,500 Liters of water for a kilo of red meat.
                Then, according to Greenpeace, cattle breeding is responsible of at least 80% of the disappearance of the Amazon rainforest. Livestock also produces more greenhouse gases than exhausts. If you take all of this information into account, eating meat is really bad for our planet and for our health in the long run! Indeed, cold meats consumption and probably red meat are carcinogenic. Eating too much processed red meat promotes cardiovascular disease, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, osteoporosis and impaired cognitive functions, among others.               
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">These insects are found to be eaten mainly in Asia : Thailand is THE country where we eat insects all day long, whether they are raw or cooked. And yes, unlike France, eating insects is not a concern at all, it is absolutely normal.
                In fact, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), insects are expected to be a sustainable alternative to animal proteins in the face of the scarcity of natural resources and the increase in the world population.
                
            <p class="halt_text"> Thus, on average, 2 kg of food is needed to produce 1 kg of insects. Another advantage is their low production of greenhouse gases, which is 10 to 100 times lower than the amount of gases created by pig production. In addition, they consume much less water than conventional livestock farming, have high quality protein and have a low risk of transmission of zoonotic disease (avian flu or coronavirus). Species of edible insects in the world, enough to vary pleasures!
                However, the representation of insects, edible or not, is not sufficiently developed in some countries. We should increase our familiarity with these new foods. It has been proven that to promote the edibility of insects, it seems interesting, initially, to offer categories of known and valued products based on insects before highlighting the products in their raw form (which could be repulsive). Insects in powder form can thus be incorporated into pasta or cereal bars, while whole insects can be covered with chocolate.
                </p>
            <p class="halt_text">Even if itâ€™s a good alternativ, they are not the only future of our planet.
                Other good actions can be made, like edible packaging is making its appearance in our kitchens! Whether it's yoghurts that can be eaten from the jar, biodegradable and edible plastic made from milk, or edible bottles made from seaweed ...
                To finish with, hopefully, the future of our planet tends towards a more responsible and ecological world where the overconsumption of red meat will be called into question.
