            <p class="halt_text">Since the 1950s, several experiments on humans have been carried out. A human is placed in a cave or a bunker without any temporal reference, neither shows nor sun to indicate that time is passing.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">The first experience is by Michel Siffre. The 16 of July 1962, Michel Siffre descended into the abyss of Scarasson, Italy, for an extreme scientific adventure of two months, alone and without any means of measuring the durations.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">Michel Siffre will give a proof to the theory of the internal clock, during these 2 months, his life will settle on a rhythm of a little more than 24 hours, with other experiences we will discover that the rhythm is 25h.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">But after a few weeks of experience, we see abnormalities in the sleep-wake rhythm. The alternation of waking phases and sleeping phases continues, and keeps a stable proportion of 2/3 of awakening for 1/3 of sleep. But these alterations are
                disrupted. Some "day-night" cycles reach 60 hours, others are shorter and last only about 12 hours.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">Throughout this period, the temperature cycle remains stable over 25 hours. When the body is hot, the subject sleeps, and when the body is cold the subject is awake.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">To come back to the conclusion of the experience, the time that Michel Siffre felt was 2 times shorter than reality. When he was told that the two months had ended, he thought he had 25 days left.
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">He will say, “The time I was perceiving was almost half as fast as the real time. While I thought I was bored for a few hours, I sometimes stayed up until 18 straight hours.”
            </p>
            <p class="halt_text">His body kept the rhythm but when he thought about taking an 1 hour nap, he could sleep more than 16 hours.
            </p>
